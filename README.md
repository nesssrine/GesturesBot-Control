# GesturesBot Control
GesturesBot Control is a project that allows you to control a robot's finger movements using hand gestures captured by your PC's camera. This project is implemented using Arduino for servo motor control and Python for hand gesture detection.

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture detection using your computer's camera.
- Precise control of the robot's fingers based on detected gestures.
- Utilizes the OpenCV and cvzone libraries for gesture detection.
- Serial communication between your computer and Arduino for servo motor control.

## Hardware Setup

- Arduino Uno 
- Servo Motors (5 servos for each finger)
- Computer Camera (for gesture capture)
- Connecting cables

## Software Setup

- Python 3.x
- Python Libraries: OpenCV, cvzone
- Arduino IDE for uploading Arduino code

## Usage

1. Ensure all hardware components are properly connected.
2. Upload the Arduino code to your Arduino.
3. Run the Python code on your computer.
4. Use hand gestures in front of the camera to control the robot's fingers.
